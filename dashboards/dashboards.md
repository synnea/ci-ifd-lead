# Dashboards using D3, DC.js and Crossfilter.js

So, you want to do a data dashboard for your second milestone, huh?

Well, the bad news is that there's probably a lot of "trial and error" in your near future. The good news is I'm here to provide a little bit of guidance, so you'll hopefully be a little less frustrated than I was for my own project.

Let's get started!

## First things first

First of all, I highly recommend heading over to [Tim's Notes](https://github.com/TravelTimN/ci-ifd-lead/blob/master/week3-d3-dc/d3-dc.md) and reading this first. It will tell you what you need to get started. 

## Crossfilter

Crossfilter is what enables the filtering across multiple charts. Unfortunately the official documentation is not highly accessible, so here are some tips for using it.
