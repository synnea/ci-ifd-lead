# Tips for Dashboards

So, you want to do a data dashboard for your second milestone, huh?

Well, the bad news is that there's probably a lot of "trial and error" in your near future. The good news is I'm here to provide a little bit of guidance, so you'll hopefully be a little less frustrated than I was for my own project.
